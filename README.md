## Contributions
**The project is not open for contributions for now.** 

There are several reasons for that:
1. I’m planning to monetize the project, for example by pinning one company at the top of the company list.
2. I have a team already working with me and a well-established workflow — additional help would only slow things down.
3. Currently, there’s a task to rebuild half of the project: [ReadyToTouch v3 — Responsive web design — Epic](https://github.com/readytotouch/readytotouch/issues/157)

Thank you for your interest and understanding!

## FAQ | Why am I working on this project?

I currently have a stable job in a MedTech project at DocHQ. But because there are many news about layoffs and many people say that finding a job is now harder, I thought about what I can do now, while I have time, to make my future job search easier and less stressful.

So I started making a list of companies that use Golang and adding developers from these companies to my contacts with a message like:  "Hi, I also work with Golang and am interested in ExampleCompanyName for future opportunities".

To improve the project, I organized it better and started collecting feedback from the Ukrainian Golang community. Later, I added support for Rust, Scala, and Elixir.
