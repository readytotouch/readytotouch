## Contributions
**The project is not open for contributions for now.** 

There are several reasons for that:
1. I’m planning to monetize the project, for example by pinning one company at the top of the company list.
2. I have a team already working with me and a well-established workflow — additional help would only slow things down.
3. Currently, there’s a task to rebuild half of the project: [ReadyToTouch v3 — Responsive web design — Epic](https://github.com/readytotouch/readytotouch/issues/157)

Thank you for your interest and understanding!
